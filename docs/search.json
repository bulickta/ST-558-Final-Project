    "text": "Modeling\nBefore delving into any specific models, we first need to split our data into a training and test set to enable evaluation, setting our seed as well so the results will be reproducible. Additionally, in each case below we center and scale our variables to be safe, although this may be unneeded based on the relatively few numeric variables all on a similar scale.\n\nset.seed(28)\nindex &lt;- createDataPartition(data$Diabetes_binary,p = 0.7,list=FALSE)\ntraining &lt;- data[index,]\ntest &lt;- data[-index,]\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nA logistic regression model is essentially a generalized approach that allows for the application of a linear model to binary using a link function, in this case the natural log. This allows the model to take in a linear combination of the explanatory variables, and then connect it to a response variable that does not have to follow the same support, in this case allowing the response to take on values of only 0 or 1. Additionally, for simplicity in this case (and because my computer runs slow otherwise with the size of this data set) we are not considering interaction terms or any higher order terms, but generally speaking these would be acceptable to include in a logistic regression model if desired.\nWe fit three models as discussed - the full model, the reduced model, and the strict model.\nAs calculating the log loss for the test data set also takes a few steps to complete, we put it in a function for ease of reproduction across all our models.\n\nlogModel1 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~.,data=training,method=\"glm\",family=\"binomial\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\")\nlogModel2 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~HighBP+HighChol+BMI+Stroke+HeartDiseaseorAttack+PhysActivity+GenHlth+PhysHlth+DiffWalk+Age+Education+Income,data=training,method=\"glm\",family=\"binomial\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\")\nlogModel3 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~HighBP+HighChol+BMI+GenHlth+DiffWalk,data=training,method=\"glm\",family=\"binomial\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\")\n\nlogLoss &lt;- function(model,testSet){\n  predvals &lt;- predict(model,newdata=testSet,type=\"raw\")\n  predprobs &lt;- predict(model,newdata=testSet,type=\"prob\")\n  lossTest &lt;- data.frame(obs=testSet$Diabetes_binary,pred=predvals,Non_Diabetic=predprobs[,1],Diabetic=predprobs[,2])\n  mnLogLoss(lossTest,lev=levels(lossTest$obs))\n}\n\nComparing our three logistic model options, we determine the full model is most effective as it minimizes log loss.\n\nlogLoss(logModel1,test)\n\n  logLoss \n0.3188558 \n\nlogLoss(logModel2,test)\n\n  logLoss \n0.3213658 \n\nlogLoss(logModel3,test)\n\n logLoss \n0.329903 \n\n\n\n\nClassification Tree\nNext, we turn our attention to a classification tree model. The idea with a classification tree is to split up the classification space by using a Gini index or deviance, essentially finding values of explanatory variables that minimize Gini/deviance to split outcomes effectively. In addition, this model comes with an additional “complexity parameter” that we will be able to determine the optimal value of during cross validation.\n\ntreeModel1 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~.,data=training,method=\"rpart\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\",tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=seq(0,0.1,0.001)))\n\ntreeModel2 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~HighBP+HighChol+BMI+Stroke+HeartDiseaseorAttack+PhysActivity+GenHlth+PhysHlth+DiffWalk+Age+Education+Income,data=training,method=\"rpart\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\",tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=seq(0,0.1,0.001)))\n\ntreeModel3 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~HighBP+HighChol+BMI+GenHlth+DiffWalk,data=training,method=\"rpart\",preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"),trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=5,summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE),metric=\"logLoss\",tuneGrid=expand.grid(cp=seq(0,0.1,0.001)))\n\nIn this case, we determine the best tree model to be the strict model variables, with a best tuning parameter as shown below.\n\nlogLoss(treeModel1,test)\n\n  logLoss \n0.3581911 \n\nlogLoss(treeModel2,test)\n\n  logLoss \n0.3581713 \n\nlogLoss(treeModel3,test)\n\n  logLoss \n0.3362954 \n\ntreeModel3$bestTune\n\n  cp\n1  0\n\n\n\n\nRandom Forest\nNext, we turn to random forest models, which in essence is the process of fitting many classification trees to bootstrapped samples and then averaging the results across predictions. This also only includes a subset of explanatory variables in each bootstrapped sample, so that if there are particularly strong variables they will not completely overshadow other variables in every tree. This also has a tuning parameter, m, which is the number of variables included in each bootstrap sample, and which can be optimized with cross validation. Additionally, in this case the cross validation is only three fold as these models take a significant amount of time to run, and rather than running a full model, reduced model and strict model in terms of variable selection, I am only using the full model in the interest of computation time.\n\nforestModel1 &lt;- train(Diabetes_binary~., data=training,method=\"rf\", preProcess=c(\"center\",\"scale\"), trControl=trainControl(method=\"cv\",number=3, summaryFunction = mnLogLoss, classProbs = TRUE), metric=\"logLoss\", tuneGrid=expand.grid(mtry=c(1:4)))\n\nIn this case, we determine the value of our tuning parameter that minimizes log loss as noted below. I am a little concerned that I may have a bug in my code since the logLoss is so high, but alas I can’t figure it out if so, and I don’t have the patience to keep test running this model!\n\nforestModel1\n\nRandom Forest \n\n177577 samples\n    21 predictor\n     2 classes: 'Non_Diabetic', 'Diabetic' \n\nPre-processing: centered (45), scaled (45) \nResampling: Cross-Validated (3 fold) \nSummary of sample sizes: 118385, 118384, 118385 \nResampling results across tuning parameters:\n\n  mtry  logLoss  \n  1     2.1716600\n  2     0.9046502\n  3     0.5566849\n  4     0.4442231\n\nlogLoss was used to select the optimal model using the smallest value.\nThe final value used for the model was mtry = 4."
